**Please note**: some of the repositories herein host PowerBASIC (PB) source code, for which unfortunately [linguist](https://github.com/github/linguist) doesn't have a definition. 
Looking at the issues for various BASIC dialects, including a PowerBASIC-specific one, it doesn't seem like PowerBASIC will be added as a language. Due to this, most PowerBASIC 
repositories have been tagged as ```VBA``` - one even ```FreeBasic```, by Github. That said, I prefixed all PB repositories with _"pb\_"_, e.g. _pb\_deletefilesolderthan_, to help you identify PB source code here.
